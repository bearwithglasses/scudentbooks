		- FrontEnd folder
			- Deleted demopages folder and moved all pages from there to FrontEnd
			- Made changes to loginpage.php so that userid is required for adding books
			- On homepage.php: rerouted Sell to addbook.html and Advanced to searchpageColumn.php
				- need to do this for other pages as well except loginpage
				- I also realized the nav bar is kind of inconsistent
			- Photos can now be uploaded (but must be small in size... find the limit later)
			- Created a confirmation page showing a preview of the listing after a book has been added
			- Titles of books serve as links to the book listing pages
			- Advanced Search function works perfectly for fields NOT involving text input
				- Don't know how to run an accurate search function using just one search bar...
			- Added pictures of books to bookimages folder for debugging (they're not pictures of books)
				- I added a LOT of books while debugging and many listings have errors -- need to be deleted.

		- FrontEnd folder

			- Modified and renamed login page
				- Login works successfully for all users in database with client-side validation
			- Modified and renamed user registration pages
				- User registration works successfully with client-side validation and adds user to database
			- Editted login accesibility
				- All users can see every page without needing to log in.
				- The homepage and navigation change depending on whether the user is signed in or not.
				- Homepage includes a 'welcome' section when user is not logged in; it disappears when the user logs in.

			- Navigation update for all pages
				- Added 'Register' and 'Login' links if a user is not logged in, and if a user logs in, the two links are removed and is replaced with a 'You' link with a dummy user navigation. User navigation includes a functional 'Log Out' link.

			- Browse by Majors pages/functionality
				- Book major categories are created dynamically on the home page. These link to their respective pages using 'categories.php' and the major parameter in the URL. Pages show a list of books that are labeled with that major.
